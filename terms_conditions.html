<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
<p>Last updated: April 26, 2025</p>

<p>These terms and conditions apply to the TrackMRR & Hit Goals mobile application ("Application") created by Lukas Nagy ("Service Provider"). The Application is provided as a Freemium service.</p>

<p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these terms automatically. Please read them carefully before using the Application. You are not allowed to copy, modify, or distribute the Application, any part of the Application, or any trademarks in any way. You may not attempt to extract the source code, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions. All intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>

<p>The Service Provider is committed to ensuring that the Application remains useful and efficient. Therefore, the Service Provider reserves the right to make changes to the Application or charge for services at any time, with clear communication of any applicable fees.</p>

<p>The Application processes personal data provided by users to deliver the intended service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your device and access to the Application. We strongly recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your device, as this could compromise your deviceâ€™s security and cause the Application to malfunction.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The Application uses third-party services, which have their own Terms and Conditions. However, currently:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No third-party service is used.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Responsibilities and Limitations</h2>
<p>The Service Provider cannot be held responsible for certain situations. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection, either via Wi-Fi or your mobile network. The Service Provider is not responsible if the Application does not function properly due to lack of internet access or data usage limits.</p>

<p>When using the Application outside of a Wi-Fi zone, remember that your mobile network provider's terms still apply. You may be charged for mobile data usage or other third-party fees.</p>

<h2>Updates and Termination</h2>
<p>The Service Provider may update the Application over time. While the Application is currently available for mobile devices according to current system requirements, future updates may require you to download newer versions to continue using it.</p>

<h2>Changes to Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>The Service Provider may update these Terms and Conditions periodically. It is recommended that you review this page regularly for any changes. Changes will be posted on this page and will take effect immediately upon posting.</p>
